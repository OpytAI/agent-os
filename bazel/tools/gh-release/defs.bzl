"""gh_release — `bazel run` a GitHub release straight from the build graph (REST API, no `gh` CLI).

A release is a side-effecting DEPLOY, not a hermetic build: it talks to api.github.com +
uploads.github.com over HTTPS, mutating a GitHub repo. So it is a `bazel run` target (client env,
network) wrapping a node uploader (publish.mjs) — node's bundled TLS + CA roots make it zero-dep and
as hermetic as a network tool gets (the node binary is the pinned rules_js toolchain, node 22).

The assets are ordinary graph outputs — the deterministic, content-addressed kernel.wasm + flavor
tars (fixed mtime/uid/gid → byte-identical per commit, so a release's bytes are reproducible). Each
rides in as a runfile; the macro hands the tool a name→runfiles-path map via one env var
(MC_RELEASE_ASSETS), each path produced by `$(rlocationpath ...)` — the SAME runfiles resolution the
JS host's e2e uses (hosts/js parity_test), so what is uploaded can't drift from the data-deps (B1).

Like //bazel/tools/size, this is a tool-scoped Starlark macro: consumers just
`load("//bazel/tools/gh-release:defs.bzl", "gh_release")`.

Usage:
    gh_release(
        name = "publish",
        repo = "OpytAI/agent-os",
        assets = {
            "//memcontainers/kernel/rust:kernel": "kernel.wasm",
            "//memcontainers/images:minimal":     "minimal.tar",
            ...
        },
    )

The tool also generates a `sha256sum -c`-compatible SHA256SUMS over the uploaded bytes and ships it
as an extra asset. Release notes are mandatory (--notes / --notes-file); GitHub auto-generated notes
are never used.

    GITHUB_TOKEN=... bazel run //bazel/tools/gh-release:publish -- --tag v0.3.0 --notes-file NOTES.md [--draft]
    bazel run //bazel/tools/gh-release:publish -- --tag v0.3.0 --notes "..." --dry-run   # validate, no network
