//! mc guest sysroot — the safe `mc` syscall surface for wasm guest programs.
//!
//! A guest links this `no_std` rlib to get three things: the `mc` import block
//! GENERATED from the syscall contract (so a guest can never import a syscall the kernel
//! doesn't serve — drift = compile error, B2); an ergonomic safe-wrapper skin over those
//! raw `i32` imports (`read`/`write_all`/`open`/`spawn`/… as `Result<T, errno>`); and the `entry!`
//! macro that exports `_start`. A guest's load-time metadata (`mc_tier`/`mc_budget`/`mc_service`) is
//! NOT declared here — both guest lanes declare it in the BUILD and stamp it post-link (`mc_program`
//! for Zig/C++, `mc_rust_program` for Rust), so the build graph is its single source. Built for
//! wasm32-unknown-unknown; every guest pointer is an offset into the guest's OWN linear
//! memory, never a host object (A6).

// The projected constants — errno, `O_*`, `TIER_*`, `SEEK_*`, `WNOHANG`, `SIG*`,
// `CAP_*` — from `constants.kdl` merged with `@shcore//:shell_abi.kdl` (B2).
// Re-exported so a guest writes `rt::ENOENT` / `rt::O_READ`, never a hand-typed
// magic number that could drift from the kernel's.
