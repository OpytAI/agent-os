//! Shell — `/bin/sh` control flow on the real kernel, driven through the console. Pipes,
//! redirection, sequencing, conditionals, command substitution, and variables — the constructs the
//! agent actually types. Each asserts the terminal response (CRLF) or, for redirection, the file
//! effect over the control channel.
